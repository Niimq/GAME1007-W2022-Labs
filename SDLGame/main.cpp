// We need to figure out how to...
//1.	get SDL header files (.h files) to be included in this project so we can call its functions in the source code
//2.	get SDL precompiled libraries (.lib files) to be linked in this project so when we compile our code it can connect with SDL's compiled code!
//3.	get SDL dynamically linked libraries to connect so that our when our application runs, it can call SDL's functions
//4.	load a texture
//5		create a game loop
//6.	create a window object and a renderer object
//7.	render images to the window

//Things to look up:
//C++ Classes and objects
// In C++ A class is a new type which "encapsulates" data members and functions.
//C++ functions
//C++ pointers
//SDL_Rect
//SDL_Texture
//SDL_Renderer
//SDL_Window
//nullptr

// Main function.
int main(int argc, char* args[]) // Main MUST have these parameters for SDL.

	myGame = Game();
	myGame.run();
	
	// Really really basic game loop forever
	while (true)
	{
		myGame.draw();

	getchar();

	myGame.cleanup();
	std::cout << "bye!" << std::endl;
